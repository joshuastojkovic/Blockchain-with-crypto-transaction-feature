# Blockchain-with-crypto-transaction-feature
python script that asks users for their name, who they are sending J2 coin too(fictional cryptocurrency) and how much they're sending. it then creates a "block" and prints the transaction detailas in words and prints the hash number of the block.

to check it is fullt working run the proigram multiple times with different inputs. if the generated has number is different each time then it'll be working fine.
