# Blockchain-with-crypto-transaction-feature
python script that asks users for their name, who they are sending J2 coin too(fictional cryptocurrency) and how much they're sending. it then creates a "block" and prints the transaction details in words and prints the hash number of the block.

to check it is fully working run the program multiple times with different inputs. if the generated hash number is different each time then it'll be working fine.
